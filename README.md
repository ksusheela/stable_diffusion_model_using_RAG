# Project Title:
AI-Powered Image Generation System Using Stable Diffusion

# Objective:

## To develop an AI-powered image generation system that creates photorealistic images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion models.

### Description:

Developed a text-to-image generation system that utilizes the Stable Diffusion model to transform text prompts into visually detailed images.

Integrated the DPMSolverMultistepScheduler (DPM-Solver++) to enhance the model's efficiency and output quality during the image generation process.

Designed a configurable interface that allows users to adjust key parameters such as guidance scale and number of inference steps for more customized results.

Ensured that the system leverages GPU acceleration (CUDA) for faster processing, enabling real-time image generation.

Implemented an image-saving feature, allowing users to download the generated images for use in various creative and professional applications.
Key Features:

Photorealistic Image Generation: Converts natural language descriptions into high-quality, realistic images.

Customizable Parameters: Users can fine-tune the generated output by adjusting guidance scale and inference steps.

Streamlit Web Interface: User-friendly web interface for interacting with the model and viewing results.

GPU-Accelerated: Utilized GPU support to speed up image generation and improve performance.

Image Download Option: Users can download the generated images for further use.

## Technologies Used:
